### Technical Highlights

#### Core Infrastructure
- **AI Orchestration**: Leverages OpenAI's Assistant API with function calling capabilities.
- **Conversational Memory**: Thread-based context management via OpenAI's persistent threads.
- **Secure Integration**: OAuth2 and session management for Proton Mail services.

#### Intelligent Tooling
```python
# Example tool execution flow
def handle_tool_call(tool_call):
    function_map = {
        "get_emails": proton.get_emails_pure,
        "create_task": todoist.create_new_task,
        # ... other tools
    }
    return dispatch_to_service(function_map[tool_call.name], tool_call.arguments)
```

#### Design Philosophy
- **Modular Service Architecture**
  - Decoupled service integrations
  - Extensible tooling system
- **Conversation-First Interface**
  - Thread-aware interactions
  - Stateful session management
- **Security-Centric**
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Secure credential storage
  - Principle of least privilege
